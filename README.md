# Dynamic-Modelling-of-Packed-Adsorption-Columns-a-Case

This study delves into the dynamic modeling of pollutant adsorption in a packed adsorption column. I utilized the finite difference approximation (FDA) and method of lines (MOL) to establish the mass balance of the pollutant within the column's volume elements. Breakthrough curves are generated to illustrate the time at which the outlet concentration of pollutant A begins to rise from zero. These simulations shed light on the system's ability to effectively remove or separate pollutant A before saturation occurs.
